Each project, especially those on [Etmad](https://portal.etimad.sa), may have different requirements, including approvals from the Finance and Accounting departments. Therefore, it's important to understand the requests and contact the right people to take things forward. Consulting the TR and relevant departments is highly recommended to proceed appropriately with the CR.

Any additional requests that will add **extra cost** such as contracting with another service provider will require your attention to provide all project financial and contractual details to the **accounting department** to allow them **to calculate the project's profit and loss.**

Any losses must be addressed by negotiating and managing them with the client, either by adding extra costs (CR), obtaining a down payment from the contract amount, or securing additional benefits, such as a future deal.
