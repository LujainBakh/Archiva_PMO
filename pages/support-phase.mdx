## 5. Support Phase

- The support phase should **start right after the project is completed** and accepted by the client.
- Once you have the **signed copy of SLA**, share the document with the **support team** via email and provide them with any relevant project links, accounts, and guidelines. The support team will assist in providing instructions for this phase.
- The RM must ensure that the client receives the **support portal account** from the support.
- The RM is responsible for **invoicing the support phase**.
