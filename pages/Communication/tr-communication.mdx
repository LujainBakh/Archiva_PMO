## 2.2 TR Communication

A thorough grasp of all project components, from technical and financial ideas to contract conditions, is necessary for effective project management. In order to ensure alignment with deadlines, specifications, and stakeholder expectations, this guidance is intended to assist project managers and teams in navigating the complexities of project execution.

- Schedule regular **follow-up meetings** with the TR at least once a week to summarize updates, particularly before client meetings.

- **Update** the plans on the **ERP** system and any change requests should be confirmed and estimated by the **TR**, not just the RM.

- Make sure to loop the TR in the **technical emails** to assist in sorting out technical discussions:
  - On-site resources should be requested one week in advance, RM is responsible for arranging with the TR.
  - Avoid providing any confirmation to clients without consulting the TR first.
  - Do not involve the TRs in non-technical meetings and emails to save their time efficiently.
  - The Project Manager is responsible for communication and information transmission between the clients and the TR.
