## 2.1 Client Communication

- Conduct a **weekly meeting** with the client's Project Manager and send status reports weekly for each project. Arrange any additional technical or business meetings as necessary and upon request.

- RM should **respond** to any emails received from the client in a timely manner.

- Ensure that the **client's expectations** are being met by regularly checking in with them through phone calls, meetings, or emails.

- **Project Meetings Attendance:** RM should attend all project-related meetings, ' including technical and business meetings. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the projects and helps prevent scope creep or any issues that may arise with the team.

- **Workshop Action Points:** Action points from workshops should be summarized and sent promptly after the conclusion of the workshops. The TR should be asked if they require any action from the client.

- **Handling Escalations:** In the event of an escalation, maintain patience with the client. Take immediate action according to the situation, and escalate to the PMO if the escalation exceeds the PM level.

- **Promise Control:** Never make promises of adding more features, expanding scope, or adjusting timelines without consulting the TR and the PMO first.

- **Client Communication:** Always provide updates or responses to the client, even if internal answers are not immediately available. Handle the situation proactively, whether through phone calls or calming emails, to ensure clients receive timely responses. Clients value quick responses.

- The tasks' responsibilities and **deviations** should be included in the **client's weekly meeting reports and in communications** to highlight any risks before they turn into issues.

In case of **any delays or risks captured,** follow the **internal escalation process and inform the PMO to take action if it's internal,** in addition to raising it and sharing it in the ERP. If it's **external**, inform the **client's PM and follow up**, including the PMO to take action immediately if necessary.
