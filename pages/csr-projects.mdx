## 4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Projects

- CSR projects do not have sales orders, hence it is still necessary to create the project in the **ERP system** and plan accordingly with the TR.
- Make sure to submit the following to the Accounting team:
  - A comprehensive timesheet containing the names of all team members, project start and end dates, and the number of working hours (this will be done with the TR)
  - The signed contract.
