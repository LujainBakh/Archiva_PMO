## 1.2.1 Main Plan

A thorough grasp of all project components, from technical and financial ideas to contract conditions, is necessary for effective project management. In order to ensure alignment with deadlines, specifications, and stakeholder expectations, this guidance is intended to assist project managers and teams in navigating the complexities of project execution.

1. **Understand Contract Time and Terms:** Begin by thoroughly reviewing the contract to understand the agreed-upon timeline and terms. <ins>This includes delivery deadlines, milestones, and any penalties for delays.</ins>

2. **Review Technical Proposal:** Examine the technical proposal provided. This will initially outline the scope of work, technical requirements, and methodologies to be employed. Incorporate these details into the project plan.

3. **Analyze Financial Proposal:** Review the financial proposal to understand payment terms allocations and breakdowns and align it with the plan.

4. **Recognize Project Uniqueness:** Understand that every project is unique and requires a tailored approach. While there may be standard project management methodologies to follow, customization is often necessary to address specific project requirements and constraints.

5. **Responsibility for High-Level Plan:** As the project manager, you are responsible for developing the high-level project plan. This includes defining milestones, major deliverables, and the main breakdown of tasks.

6. **Detailed Development Sprints:** If the client requests a fully detailed plan, collaborate with the TR to incorporate development sprints or iterations into the development milestone in the project plan.

7. **Integrate External/Internal Systems:** Identify any external or internal integrations required for the project. Allocate sufficient time in the project plan for integration activities, considering the complexities involved.

8. **Integration Duration:** Treat integration as a critical aspect of the project and allocate appropriate time for it within the project timeline. Delays in integration can significantly impact project delivery and increase risks.

9. **Integration Requirements from Client:** Create a separate list outlining the integration business and technical requirements that need to be provided by the client. Communicate these requirements and establish deadlines for their submission.

10. **Risk Management:** Recognize the high risk associated with delays in the integration period. Implement risk management strategies to mitigate these risks, such as proactive communication with stakeholders, contingency planning, and main plan adjustments.

11. **Regular Follow-Up:** Maintain regular communication with the client and other stakeholders regarding integration requirements and progress. Follow up on outstanding requirements to ensure timely completion and minimize the risk of delays.

12. **Iterative Planning:** Understand that project planning is not a one-time activity. Continuously revisit and refine the project plan throughout the project lifecycle to adapt to changing circumstances, mitigate risks, and ensure successful delivery.

It is essential to **review the project plan with the TR and the PMO and submit it within a week after the project starting date to avoid any project delays,** the project plan should also be **approved** by the client.

Add the **relevant payment terms to the project in the ERP** system and **update** the shared **delivery calendar** with all the deliverables, **whether payment-related or not, to align with the engineering sector.**

Please consider **3 to 5 days** for client approvals for each deliverable in the plan and avoid setting submission dates **on weekends or holidays.** And to **keep in mind that the TR cannot start without the plan.**

Add the **start, end, and actual dates for each task and milestone in the plans;** this can be easily captured in the **ERP.**

Adding the **actual dates** to the plan will help the RM **to capture any deviations.**
