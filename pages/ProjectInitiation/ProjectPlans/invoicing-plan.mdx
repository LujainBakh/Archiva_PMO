## 1.2.2 Invoicing Plan

Ensure that invoicing plans are accurate and that the process is completed smoothly
until the end of the project.

- **Accuracy** in the invoicing plan and invoicing movements is crucial and it should be appropriately reflected in the ERP system.

- Make sure that RFCs or COCs are getting **signed by the client** before issuing the final invoices.

- If a client uploads the COCs directly on Etmad **without signing** our COCs, inform the Accounting and Finance departments via email and they will proceed further.

- Any **approved change requests** (timely or financially) should be communicated to PMO, Accounting and Finance departments to update the total amounts accurately. Acknowledgment should be via email and by updating your PMO follow-up files.

- Any **changes** to invoicing during the project must be promptly communicated to both the **PMO** and the **Finance Department.**

- Any **changes** to the invoicing that may be affected because of the deliverables should be communicated to the **TR.**

- Add all the **COCs and issued invoices** into the **drive project folder.**

> RFC - Request for Approval to Issue a Financial Claim
>
> COC - Certificate of Completion
