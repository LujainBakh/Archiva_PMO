## 1.1 Project Kick-off Meeting

- Upon receiving the introductory email for a new project, coordination with the client's designated focal point is crucial to schedule the kick-off meeting. This significant meeting will involve key participants from our side, including the Relationship Manager (RM), Project Management Office (PMO), and Technical Representative (TR).

- Once a project is assigned to one of the RMs, Google Drive folder will be provided and the RM should set up the project on the ERP system, adding the initial start and end dates and adding the sales order based on the payment terms.

- The kick-off presentation will be conducted by the RM, emphasizing the need for thorough preparation. Prior to the meeting, both the TR and PMO are expected to review the kick-off presentation carefully. This collaborative effort ensures alignment and clarity in our communication.

- Once the kick-off meeting concludes, it is important to send the **minutes of meeting (MOM)** summarizing the entire discussion to the client, providing them with a comprehensive overview of the topics covered and decisions made during the kick-off meeting.

- The **project charter** and communication plan should be shared, completed, and signed by both parties at the project's outset. The invoicing plan can proceed once the project plan is finalized and approved
